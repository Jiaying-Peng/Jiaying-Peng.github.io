Although high ionic conductivities have been achieved in most solid‐state electrolytes used in lithium metal batteries (LMBs), rapid and stable lithium‐ion transport between solid‐state electrolytes and lithium anodes remains a great challenge due to the high interfacial impedances and infinite volume changes of metallic lithium. In this work, a chemical vapor‐phase fluorination approach is developed to establish a lithiophilic surface on rubber‐derived electrolytes, which results in the formation of a resilient, ultrathin, and mechanically integral LiF‐rich layer after electrochemical cycling. The resulting ultraconformal layer chemically connects the electrolyte and lithium anode and maintains dynamic contact during operation, thus facilitating rapid and stable lithium‐ion transport across interfaces, as well as promoting uniform lithium deposition and inhibiting side reactions between electrolyte components and metallic …
