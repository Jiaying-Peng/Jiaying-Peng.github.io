Although composite solid-state electrolytes (CSEs) are considered promising ionic conductors for high-energy lithium metal batteries, their unsatisfactory ionic conductivity, low mechanical strength, poor thermal stability, and narrow voltage window limit their practical applications. We have prepared a new lithium superionic conductor (Li-HA-F) with an ultralong nanofiber structure and ultrahigh room-temperature ionic conductivity (12.6 mS cm–1). When it is directly coupled with a typical poly(ethylene oxide)-based solid electrolyte, the Li-HA-F nanofibers endow the resulting CSE with high ionic conductivity (4.0 × 10–4 S cm–1 at 30 °C), large Li+ transference number (0.66), and wide voltage window (5.2 V). Detailed experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that Li-HA-F supplies continuous dual-conductive pathways and results in stable LiF-rich interfaces, leading to its excellent performance. Moreover, the Li …
