excerpt: 'We report a novel lithium superionic conductor, Li-HA-F, featuring an ultralong nanofiber morphology and exceptional room-temperature ionic conductivity (12.6 mS cm⁻¹). When incorporated into a PEO-based composite solid-state electrolyte (CSE), it significantly enhances ionic conductivity (4.0 × 10⁻⁴ S cm⁻¹ at 30 °C), Li⁺ transference number (0.66), and electrochemical stability window (5.2 V). Li-HA-F enables dual-conductive pathways and LiF-rich interfacial layers, contributing to long-term cycling stability (2000 h) and high critical current density (1.4 mA cm⁻²). The resulting CSE also exhibits excellent mechanical strength, flexibility, and flame resistance, supporting high-performance operation in LFP and NCM-based solid-state batteries across a wide temperature range.' # 文章摘要，用于首页显示

Although composite solid-state electrolytes (CSEs) are considered promising ionic conductors for high-energy lithium metal batteries, their unsatisfactory ionic conductivity, low mechanical strength, poor thermal stability, and narrow voltage window limit their practical applications. We have prepared a new lithium superionic conductor (Li-HA-F) with an ultralong nanofiber structure and ultrahigh room-temperature ionic conductivity (12.6 mS cm–1). When it is directly coupled with a typical poly(ethylene oxide)-based solid electrolyte, the Li-HA-F nanofibers endow the resulting CSE with high ionic conductivity (4.0 × 10–4 S cm–1 at 30 °C), large Li+ transference number (0.66), and wide voltage window (5.2 V). Detailed experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that Li-HA-F supplies continuous dual-conductive pathways and results in stable LiF-rich interfaces, leading to its excellent performance. Moreover, the Li …
