A continuous 2D carbon network was introduced into silicon anodes, significantly enhancing conductivity, structural stability, and Li-ion diffusion. The resulting Si@GCNS anode showed high capacity (2975 mAh g⁻¹), long cycle life, and excellent rate performance, making it promising for next-generation lithium-ion batteries.
